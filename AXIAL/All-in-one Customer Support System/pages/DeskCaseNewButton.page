<apex:page standardController="Deskcom__Case__c">
<h1>New Desk.com Cases</h1>
<p/>
If you would like to create a new Desk.com case, please navigate to
the relevant Contact or Lead's page (Desk.com cases have to be
associated with a Contact or Lead) and then click on the 'Create
Remote Desk Case' button on that page. If you don't see that button, ask your 
Salesforce org administrator to add the Desk.com VisualForce page to your Contact and
Lead layouts. 
<p/>
If, after creating the Remote Desk Case, you don't see the new data
here in your Salesforce org and you expected to, check with your Desk.com administrator to
ensure that you have the correct Rules set up that will create Desk.com cases 
in Salesforce whenever a new interaction comes into your Desk site.
