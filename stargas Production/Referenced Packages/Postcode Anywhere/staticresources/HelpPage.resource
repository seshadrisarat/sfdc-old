                    <br />
                    <b>Where do I start?</b><br />
                    <p>The first thing you will need is a Postcode Anywhere account. You can register for an account quickly and with no obligation by either using the registration form on the Management tab or by going to <a href="http://www.postcodeanywhere.com/register" target="_blank">www.postcodeanywhere.com/register/</a>. If you register on the website you will need to generate a per click web service key and enter this into the Management page. Don't forget to press save! </p>
                    <p>Your account will come with 30 free Standard Credits and 30 free Royal Mail PAF credits for you to trial the service with. We're happy to provide limited additional credits for testing if required. Further credits and licenses should be purchased online or over the phone as required.</p>
                    
                    <b>How do I pay for the service?</b><br />
                    <p>The international and USPS address lookups are licensed on a pay-per-click credit system. Each time you enter a zip or postcode the service will retrieve a list of streets which consumes 1 standard credit for UK, US and Canadian addresses and 2 standard credits for all other countries.</p>
                    <p>
                        The UK address lookups are licensed on a per-user basis. The internal user 
                        licenses include 1,000 lookups per day per Salesforce user. Transactional credit 
                        packs are avaiable for organisations with many users but not looking up many addresses 
                        per user. For public facing websites (for instance, if you are using the service on a 
                        Web-To-Lead form) you will can use the pay-per-click credit system; in this case 1 PAF 
                        credit will be deducted from your account every time an address is completed.</p>
                    
                    <b>What does the service cost?</b><br />
                    <p>For up to date pricing please see our website <a href="http://www.postcodeanywhere.com" target="_blank">www.postcodeanywhere.com</a></p>
                    
                    <b>How do I enable address lookups in the standard edit pages?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        To use the lookup functionality in the standard edit pages you will need to add 
                        the custom sidebar component to the sidebar and ensure it is visible on all 
                        pages. To do this:</p>
                    <p>
                        Go to Setup - Customise - Home - Homepage Layouts, and select the layout for the 
                        appropriate profiles. Make sure there is a tick next to Postcode Anywhere in the 
                        "Select Narrow Components to Show" section. On the next page make sure it is in 
                        the Narrow (Left) Column list and press Save.</p>
                        
                    <b>How do I enable address lookups Visual Force pages?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        It is possible to use the standard component to enable address lookups in 
                        Visual Force pages by creating an address integration from the Postcode Anywhere 
                        app Management page and providing the apex Id's of the fields to be used. <br />
                        e.g. txtLeadStreet</p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively you can use the included Address VisualForce Component in any
                        VisualForce page using the following tag:</p>
                    <p>
                        &lt;c:Address label=&quot;Custom&quot; Street=&quot;{!Lead.Street}&quot; 
                        City=&quot;{!Lead.City}&quot; State=&quot;{!Lead.State}&quot; Zip=&quot;
                        {!Lead.PostalCode}&quot; Country=&quot;{!Lead.Country}&quot; License=&quot;
                        AA11-AA11-AA11-AA11&quot;/&gt;</p>
                    <p>
                        The label parameter will add a label to each of your address fields, e.g. 
                        &quot;Billing&quot;, &quot;Shipping&quot;. You will need to change each of the 
                        address field parameters to the fields you want to populate and specifcy your 
                        Postcode Anywhere License Key.</p>
                    <p>
                        If you wish it is also possible to use the JavaScript code directly by including 
                        the LookupComponent script from Static Resources in the Visual Force page.</p>
                    <p>
                        The VisualForce Component and Static Resource solutions will require some 
                        knowlege of JavaScript to customise the country list and other aspects.</p>
                    
                    <b>How do I lookup an address?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        To look up an address, simply:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. Select the country from the list. If the country you wish to enter an address 
                        for does not appear in the list then select the 'Other' option at the bottom of 
                        the list. The list will turn into a textbox allowing you to type the country 
                        name.</p>
                    <p>
                        2. Enter the postal or zip code.</p>
                    <p>
                        3. Click Find or Tab into the street field. A list of the available streets will appear if 
                        the postcode is valid. You can then type the building name or number. Start typing 
                        the street name to refine the list, or just select the street from the list by clicking 
                        on it. Once you have selected the street your address should be complete, but you are free 
                        to edit any part if needed.</p>
                        
                    <b>How do reverse lookups work?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        Reverse lookups are available for Royal Mail and USPS data. It is intended to 
                        allow you to find the postal code / zip code in cases where you do not know it. 
                        This will, in most cases, allow you to enter just the company name and 
                        lookup the address. If the service cannot find the address for you straight away 
                        try adding some additional information in the address fields to help it.</p>
                    
                    <b>The address lookups have stopped working, what's going on?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        If the service stops working, you will receive an e-mail explaining the problem. 
                        This is usually down to one of three reasons:</p>
                    <p>
                        1. You have run out of credits, in which case you will need to buy some more to 
                        continue using the service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. You have hit the daily usage limit for the license key you are using. This is 
                        a security measure to make sure your account credits aren't mistakenly wiped out 
                        in one go. You can increase your daily limit at any time by logging into your 
                        Postcode Anywhere account; the service will resume operation as soon as the 
                        limit has been increased.</p>
                    <p>
                        3. You may have an outstanding debt on your account; once this has been paid, 
                        the service will resume as normal.</p>
                    
                    <b>How do I change the countries in the country selection list?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        You will need to go to the Management tab, where you can use the buttons to 
                        select which countries you want to appear in the list - as well as the order in 
                        which they appear. The country at the top will effectively be the default 
                        country. If no countries are added to the list then the standard text field will 
                        be shown.</p>
                    
                    <b>What is USPS Data and how do I use it?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        The United States Postal Service data is licensed from USPS and will return 
                        data at premise level, whereas the International service will only resolve to 
                        street level.</p>
                    <p>
                        In short, USPS data is quicker, easier and more accurate for 
                        addresses within the US. To enable USPS 
                        address data, go to the Management tab, select "USPS Data" and 
                        press Save. The USPS data will then automatically be used whenever 
                        United States of America or a US territory is selected as the country, 
                        and ZIP+4 is entered in the zip field.</p>
                    
                    <b>What is UK Royal Mail Data and how do I use it?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        The United Kingdom data is licensed from the Royal Mail and will return data at 
                        premise level, whereas the International service will only resolve to street 
                        level.</p>
                    <p>
                        In short, the Royal Mail UK data is quicker, easier and more accurate for 
                        addresses within the UK. To enable UK 
                        address data, go to the Management tab, select "Royal Mail Data" and 
                        press Save. The UK data will then automatically be used whenever 
                        United Kingdom or a UK terrototy is selected as the country.</p>
                    
                    <b>How do I disable address lookups?</b><br />
                    <p>
                        To disable the address lookup functionality in the edit pages you need to remove 
                        that component from the sidebar. To do this:</p>
                    <p>
                        Go to Setup - Customise - Home - Homepage Layouts, and select the layout for the 
                        appropriate profiles. Unselect Postcode Anywhere and save the changes.</p>
                    <p>
                        To disable functionality for a specific address you can go to the Management tab 
                        and delete the Address Integration relating to that address form.</p>
                    
                    <b>How do I put Postcode Anywhere address lookup on my Web-To-Lead form?</b> <br />
                    <p>We recommend using our International SmartForm for International Web-To-Lead forms or our inline address finder pop-up for UK only implementations. A demo can be found at <a href="http://www.postcodeanywhere.com/products/address_finder_international/demos.aspx" target="_blank">www.postcodeanywhere.com/products/address_finder_international/demos.aspx</a>  and details on implementing it can be found at <a href="http://www.postcodeanywhere.com/developers/tutorials/internationalsf.aspx" target="_blank">www.postcodeanywhere.com/developers/tutorials/internationalsf.aspx</a></p>

                    When adding a new Address Integration you will need to specify the HTML DOM IDs of the 
                    fields. You can find the field IDs by taking the last part of the address when 
                    viewing the field detail pages - for example:</p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://na1.salesforce.com/00N30000001euGe">
                    https://na1.salesforce.com/00N30000001euGe</a><br />
                    gives you the field ID...<br />
                    00N30000001euGe</p>
                <p>
                    All five fields are required for the integration.</p>
                
                <b>Custom Code</b><br />
                <p>
                    Adding custom code allows you to customise the app in any way you want. The app 
                    will run JavaScript functions when different events happen:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Initialise - When an address control is loaded.</li>
                <li>Search - When the component does a search. Execute functions on this event to prepopulate fields before specific items are selected.</li>
                <li>Select - When the user selects an address. Execute functions here to populate additional fields or make additional service calls based on the address.</li>
                <li>Clear - When an address is cleared. Execute functions here to clear additional fields or set default values.</li>
                <li>Error - When an error occurs. Execute functions here to output or handle the error.</li>
                <li>Change - When an address is changed. Execute functions here to ensure address validity.</li>
                <li>Country - When the country field changes. Execute functions here that are country specific.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Example on Error event:</p>
                <p>- Output the error:</p>
                <p>function (error) {<br />
                alert(error);<br />
                }</p>
                
                <p>Example on Select event:</p>
                <p>- To populate a custom field (00N30000001euGe) with the UDPRN for UK Royal Mail 
                    data:</p>
                <p>function () {<br />
                if (this.data.source == 1)<br />
                document.getElementById(&quot;00N30000001euGe&quot;).value = 
                    this.data.addresses[this.data.item].Udprn;<br />
                }</p>
                
                <p>Example on Change event:</p>
                <p>- Check that a valid USPS or Royal Mail address has been selected and not 
                    changed:</p>
                <p>function () {<br />
                    if (this.valid)<br />
                    document.getElementById(&quot;00N30000001euGe&quot;).value = "valid address";<br />
                    else<br />
                    document.getElementById(&quot;00N30000001euGe&quot;).value = "address not valid";<br />
                }</p>
            <br />
